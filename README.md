# Pipelined_Mips_Processor


<br>

In computer architecture, the concept of pipelining is a critical technique that enhances the efficiency and performance of microprocessors. Pipelining allows multiple instructions to be overlapped in execution, much like an assembly line in a factory. 
Pipelining is a fundamental technique in modern CPU design that significantly improves instruction throughput. Understanding the five stages of a pipeline—Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back—provides insights into how processors manage and execute multiple instructions efficiently. Each stage is intricately linked and optimized to minimize delays and maximize performance. Advanced techniques like parallelism, hazard detection, and caching are employed to further enhance the pipeline's efficiency, ensuring that modern processors can handle complex and demanding computational tasks with speed and precision.
